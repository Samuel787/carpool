CS2102 Project
Carpool
This is a CS2102 Project done during AY19/20 S1. It allows users to sign up, then depending on when they sign up, they will be able to select if they want to be a driver or they want to be a passenger. Drivers are able to advertise rides and add the number of stops along the way. Passengers are able to bid for rides and drivers can accept the bids in real time. At the end of the ride users can give a rating to the driver and pay for their rides.
